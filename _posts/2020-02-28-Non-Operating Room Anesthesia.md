Currently, if a complex interventional procedure requires anesthesia care, it is typically performed in specialized settings remote from the operating room due to advances in technology in electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). These patients are often at high risk of oversedation and hemodynamic instability due to severe cardiovascular disease or pulmonary comorbidities. It is not uncommon for even healthy patients to become uncomfortable if they remain motionless for too long. Consequently, there has been an increase in the demand for monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and general anesthesia in these off-site settings.
