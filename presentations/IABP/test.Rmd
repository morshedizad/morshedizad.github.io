## Indications for Placement

- In the cardiac catheterization laboratory
  - High-grade lesion of proximal coronary vessels
  - MI occurs after an intervention 

- LV failure despite moderate-to-high-dose inotropic support 

- Evidence of ongoing regional myocardial ischemia

## Contraindications to Placement

- Aortic Insufficiency
- Sepsis
- Sever Vascular Disease

## Functional Design

- The balloon inflates during diastole

- Increasing aortic diastole pressure 

- Balloon inflation improves coronary perfusion pressure

- During early systole, rapid balloon deflation reduces LV afterload

## IABP Placement 

- The balloon is ideally positioned so that its tip is at the junction of the descending aorta and the aortic arch

- Radiographically the tip should lie between the anterior portion of the second intercostal space and the first lumbar vertebra

- When the IABP is placed intraoperatively, TEE can confirm proper tip location before initiation of balloon assitance

## IABP Control
- Synchronization of the IABP
  - Cardiac rhythm (EKG - Arterial Pressure waveform) 
- Timing of Balloon Inflation and Deflation
  - It is important to time the onset of the pressure rise caused by balloon inflation with the dicrotic notch of the arterial waveform
- Ratio of Native Ventricle Pulsations to IABP Pulsation

- Stroke Volume of the Balloon

## Balloon Too Small

## IABP Weaning

- Weaning is done primarily by gradually decreasing the ratio of augmented to native heartbeats

## Management of Anticoagulation During IABP Assistance

- During extended IABP use, anticoagulation is generally indicated

- If heparin is used, adequate anticoagulation should be confirmed every 4 to 6 hours with ACT or PTT

## Complication

- Limb Ischemia 
- Compartment Syndrome
- Mesenteric Infarction
- Aortic Perforation
- Aortic Dissection

## IABP Complications

## Risk Factors for Complication
- Peripheral Vascular Disease
- Female Gender
- Tobacco Smoking 
- DM
