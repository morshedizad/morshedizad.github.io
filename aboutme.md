After receiving my Doctor of Medicine (DM) from Yazd Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences (2012), I completed my education in Medical Science as Anesthesiologist four years later at Kerman University of Medical Sciences (2016). I continued my career as an anesthesiologist at Vali_e_Asr General Hospital, Shahr Babak, Kerman, from November 21, 2016, to September 11, 2018. Now, I am the anesthesiologist at Koohbanan General Hospital, Koohbanan, Kerman, Iran. I would like to continue my career as a researcher in anesthesiology and its related fields. I have been conducting a heart anesthesia fellowship at Shahid Rajaei Heart Center since September 2020.
